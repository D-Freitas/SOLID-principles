# SOLID PRINCIPLES

<pre>
SRP -> Single Responsibility Principle
OCP -> Open Closed Principle
LSP -> Liskov Substitution Pricinple
ISP -> Interface Segregation Principle
DIP -> Dependency Inversion Principle
</pre>

### SRP
Files, Classes, Methods, Functions, Variables e etc, should not have two or more responsibilities

### OCP
If there is an addition in business rules, the class responsible for the implementation must be closed for alteration and open for extension

![OCP](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/47615360/167480553-63f74ff6-6556-4296-aad1-a4a33cb7430a.png)

### LSP
The child class must not influence the behavior of the parent class

### ISP
Avoid generalizing interfaces so as not to force implementation of unnecessary rules

![ISP](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/47615360/167504140-65226cab-2c49-47e2-bfc1-73b77dcd81f1.png)

### DIP
Avoid coupling by making dependency injection dependent on an abstraction of the class to be injected, thus decoupling them
